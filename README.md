<h2>Application</h2>
The application works as an open forum for logging bugs or TODOs for my own projects. It uses GraphQL subscribers to an API to sync updates across any active users sessions in real time.  The application implements user authentication and uses a cloud hosted DynamoDB instance for storage. This application is focuses on functionality and minimal time was put into the aesthetic of the UI.
