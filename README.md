<h2>Application</h2>
<p>The application works as an open forum for logging bugs or TODOs for my own college projects while working alone or as part of a group while still in college. This could act as a kanban board while working remotely.</p> 
<p>It uses GraphQL subscribers to an API to sync updates across any active users sessions in real time. The application implements user authentication and uses a cloud hosted DynamoDB instance for storage.</p>
<p>This application is focuses on functionality and minimal time was put into the aesthetic of the UI.</p>
